*** I made a new project as I am interested in improving and submitting it on GOOGLEPLAY later.
*** Some concepts used in this project:
*** 1- GUI ---> Buttons, TextView, WebViews, Layout
*** 2- Paying Attention to the Material Design ---> Tab Layout is used for switching between fragments
*** 3- Fragments ---> Generating, handling using pageview
*** 4- Life Time of an activity & freagments ---> using SharedPreferences to save keydata
